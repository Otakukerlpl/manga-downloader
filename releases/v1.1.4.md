# v1.1.4

Small quality-of-life and release automation updates.

## Changes
- Add a small CLI helper `bin/ping-url.js` to measure latency to a URL (HEAD request).
- Prepare release metadata and housekeeping for `v1.1.4`.
- Miscellaneous UI and packaging tweaks.

## Notes
- To measure a URL latency from the repo root:

```
node .\bin\ping-url.js https://miku-doujin.com/fpxwd/
```

- Packaging and published installer artifacts may still require CI or sufficient disk space on the builder. If you need me to build and publish artifacts, I can attempt a local build (requires freeing disk space) or re-run CI after AppVeyor/GitHub billing is resolved.

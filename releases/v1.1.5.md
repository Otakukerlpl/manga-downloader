# v1.1.5 — December 9, 2025

Small maintenance and reliability release focusing on locked-content access and release tooling.

Highlights

- **Improved locked-content support:** Added Puppeteer interactive login flows and helpers to load/save cookies so the downloader can access images that require a logged-in session (best-effort for OAuth sites).
- **Domain-restricted auto-login:** Auto-login/auto-unlock runs only for domains you explicitly allow (see GUI field `Auto-login domains` and CLI `--auto-login-domains`).
- **Cookie & profile persistence:** Save cookies to `.cookies/<host>.json` or provide a custom cookie file (CLI/GUI). You can also reuse an existing Chrome profile via `--chrome-profile` or the GUI option for more reliable login reuse.
- **Ping UI:** The GUI now displays current ping/latency so you can monitor connection performance while downloading.
- **Packaging & release fixes:** Fixed packaging cache issues that caused local `electron-builder` extraction failures; Windows installer artifacts (`.exe`, `.blockmap`, `latest.yml`) are now created for releases and uploaded for auto-update support.
- **CLI/GUI flags:** New flags/options for Puppeteer, interactive auth, cookie save/load, auto-login, and profile reuse to give you flexible control over locked content workflows.

Notes & recommendations

- For sites using Google OAuth or other strict federated login flows, prefer supplying a `--chrome-profile` path (reuse an already-logged-in profile) or perform one interactive run and `--save-cookies` to capture a reusable cookie file.
- Auto-login is best-effort and intentionally domain-gated; it will only run for domains listed in `autoLoginDomains` to avoid unexpected credential usage.

If you run into issues with packaging or creating releases in CI, ensure the runner has sufficient disk space and permission to extract signing artifacts (clearing the electron-builder cache resolved a prior failure).
